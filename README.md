# Case Study: Fachinformatiker fÃ¼r Anwendungsentwicklung


We've built a cool game which is called "Case Study" :smile:, in which a Paddle can be moved by the mouse and when ever the Beachball touches this Paddle the player gets 1 point and `Devin` is always there saying the current score.

## Task 1:

This game is build using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) which is a visual programming language that can be used as an educational tool for coding, please try to get your self familiar with Scratch by trying out a (tutorial)[https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted] or you can also search the internet for more tutorials on Scratch; here you will find other tutorials on Youtube for example [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=scratch](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=scratch)

You can also read more about it in:
- https://scratch.mit.edu/
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)
## Task 2:

Now that you are familiar with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), unfortunately there's a problem in our game. The problem is: `Devin` is saying "0" all the time and not the current player score.

You can start using our game project file [Case_Study_Candidate_Version.sb3](./Case_Study_Candidate_Version.sb3) in Scratch by selecting `File -> Load from your computer` then selecting the project file.

Now that you have the code, please fix this problem in the game as the players are complainig about it!

Try running the game after fixing the problem to make sure it still works.
## Task 3:

Now that the problem is fixed, our creative team came up with more ideas to make the game exciting for players.

The team would like `Devin` to not just say the current score but instead:

1. If the score can be divided by 3, `Devin` should say "Fizz"
2. If the score can be divided by 5, `Devin` should say "Buzz"
3. Otherwise he will just say the score

You can checkout the video [case_goal.mov](./case_goal.mov) to see how should the game look like.

Can you please do those changes to the game! The creative team will appreciate this alot. :pray:
